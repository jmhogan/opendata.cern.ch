=== "2010"

    ### Using virtual machine
    
    To analyse CMS data collected in 2010, you need **version 4.2.8** of CMSSW, supported only on **Scientific Linux 5**. If you are unfamiliar with Linux, take a look at [this short introduction to Linux](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookBasicLinux) or try this interactive [command-line bootcamp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/). Once you have installed the [CMS-specific CERN Virtual Machine](/docs/cms-virtual-machine-2010), you need to open a terminal. In the "CMS-OpenData-1.1.2" VM, always use the "CMS shell" terminal available from the "CMS Shell" icon on the desktop (only if using the VM version "CMS-OpenData-1.0.0-rc7", open a terminal with the X terminal emulator from an icon bottom-left of the VM screen). Execute the following command in the terminal if you haven't done so before; it ensures that you have this version of CMSSW running:

    ```shell
    $ cmsrel CMSSW_4_2_8
    ```

    Then, make sure that you are always in the **CMSSW_4_2_8/src/** directory and the CMS analysis environment is properly setup by entering the following commands in the terminal (you must do so every time you boot the VM before you can proceed):

    ```shell
    $ cd CMSSW_4_2_8/src/
    $ cmsenv
    ```

    ### Using Docker container

    If you do not want to work on a virtual machine, you can try to to analyse CMS data in a Docker container, following the [instruction](/docs/cms-guide-docker).
    
=== "2011/2012"

    ### Using Docker container
    
    To analyse CMS data collected in 2011 and 2012, you need **version 5.3.32** of CMSSW, supported only on **Scientific Linux 6**. If you are unfamiliar with Linux, take a look at [this short introduction to Linux](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookBasicLinux) or [tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). Once you have installed the [CMS open data container](/docs/cms-guide-docker) or the [CMS-specific CERN Virtual Machine](/docs/cms-virtual-machine-2011), you need to open a terminal.
    
    ### Using virtual machine
    
    If you are using the VM, always use the "CMS shell" terminal available from the "CMS Shell" icon on the desktop for all CMSSW-specific commands, such as compilation and run. In the VM "CMS Shell", execute the following command in the terminal if you haven't done so before; it ensures that you have this version of CMSSW running:

    ```shell
    $ cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_32
    ```

    Note that if you get a warning message about the current OS not being slc6, you are using a wrong terminal ("Outer Shell") which is CERN CentOS 7 (cc7). Open a "CMS Shell" terminal as explained above and execute the cmsrel command there.

    In the VM, the CMS analysis environment needs to be properly setup by entering the following commands in the terminal (you must do so every time you boot the VM before you can proceed):

    ```shell
    $ cd CMSSW_5_3_32/src/
    $ cmsenv # do not execute this command if you are working in the container
    ```

    <a name="container">Make sure that you are always in the **CMSSW_5_3_32/src/** directory, both in the CMS open data container</a> and in the VM (and in the "CMS Shell" terminal in VM).


## <a name="data">"What is in the CMS data?"</a>

The primary data provided by CMS on the CERN Open Data Portal are in a format called "Analysis Object Dataâ€œ or AOD for short. These AOD files are prepared by piecing raw data collected by various sub-detectors of CMS and contain all the information that is needed for analysis. The list and the description of the physics objects contained in the AOD files can be found through the links for [2010](/docs/cms-physics-objects-2010) and for [2011](/docs/cms-physics-objects-2011). The AOD files cannot be opened and understood as simple data tables. To read these files, you would need [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch), a framework used by several particle-physics experiments to work with the collected data.

The following instructions will walk you through the steps of checking the content of AOD files. 

=== "2010"

        Make sure that you are in the **CMSSW_4_2_8/src/** folder (and in the "CMS Shell" terminal, if using the "CMS-OpenData-1.1.2" VM). Also make sure that you have executed the `cmsenv` command in your terminal to launch the CMS analysis environment.

        You can now open a CMS AOD file in ROOT. Let us open one of the files from the CERN Open Data Portal by entering the following command:

        ```shell
        $ root root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2010B/Mu/AOD/Apr21ReReco-v1/0000/00459D48-EB70-E011-AF09-        90E6BA19A252.root
        ```

        You will see the ROOT logo appear on screen. You can now open the ROOT GUI by entering:

        ```shell
        TBrowser t
        ```

        Excellent! You have successfully opened a CMS AOD file in ROOT. If this was the first time you've done so, pat yourself on the back. Now, to see what is inside this file, let us take a closer look at some collections of [physics objects](/docs/cms-physics-objects-2010#cms-data).

        On the left window of ROOT (see the screenshot below), double-click on the file name (`root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/...`). You should see a list of entries under `Events`, each corresponding to a collection of reconstructed data. We are interested in the collections containing information about reconstructed physics objects.

        <img src="/static/docs/getting-started-with-cms-2010-data/cms_tbrowser.png" width="70%">

        Let us take a peek, for example, at the electrons, which are found in `recoGsfElectrons_gsfElectrons__RECO`, as shown on the list of [physics objects](/docs/cms-physics-objects-2010). Look in there by double-clicking on that line and then double-clicking on `recoGsfElectrons_gsfElectrons__RECO.obj`. Here, you can have a look at various properties of this collection, such as the plot for the transverse momentum of the electrons: `recoGsfElectrons_gsfElectrons__RECO.obj.pt_`.

        You can exit the ROOT browser through the GUI by clicking on `Browser` on the menu and then clicking on `Quit Root` or by entering `.q` in the terminal.

=== "2011/2012"

        Make sure that you are in the **CMSSW_5_3_32/src/** folder (and, in VM, you have executed the `cmsenv` command in your terminal).

        Select a dataset, for example, the [ElectronHad dataset](/record/24404) from Run2012A. You can select a file, (a listing is available for each dataset record) and print out it contents with:

        ```shell
        $ edmDumpEventContent root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2012A/ElectronHad/AOD/22Jan2013-v1/20000/FEE9E03A-F581-E211-8758-002618943901.root
        ```

        The ouput is a list of different objects that the file contains, such as

        ```shell
            Type                                  Module                      Label             Process
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            edm::TriggerResults                   "TriggerResults"            ""                "HLT"
            trigger::TriggerEvent                 "hltTriggerSummaryAOD"      ""                "HLT"
            [...]
            vector<reco::GsfElectron>             "gsfElectrons"              ""                "RECO"
            [...]
            vector<reco::Muon>                    "muons"                     ""                "RECO"
            [...]
        ```

        Documentation of the objects of main interest to physics analysis is available in [the CMS Open Data guide](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/analysis/selection/objects/objects/). The objects are implemented as C++ classes in the CMS software package [CMSSW](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw), and detailed reference documentation of all classes is available in [the class list of the CMSSW reference manual](https://cmsdoxygen.web.cern.ch/cmsdoxygen/CMSSW_5_3_30/doc/html/annotated.html). To see the properties of electrons, you would navigate to the [namespace "reco"](https://cmsdoxygen.web.cern.ch/cmsdoxygen/CMSSW_5_3_30/doc/html/d1/d57/namespacereco.html) and find the entry for `GsfElectron`. The [reco::GsfElectron Class Reference](https://cmsdoxygen.web.cern.ch/cmsdoxygen/CMSSW_5_3_30/doc/html/d0/d6d/classreco_1_1GsfElectron.html) lists all member functions through which the different properties of a reconstructed electron can be accessed. Note that many of the basic properties are "inherited" from the parent classes, and are listed separately under "Public Member Functions inherited from ... ". You can find more information on each object in the CMS Open Data guide (e.g. [electrons](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/analysis/selection/objects/electrons/)).

        These objects can be accessed in a software module which can be built with a helper script available in the CMS open data environment. Do the following:

        ```shell
        $ mkdir Demo
        $ cd Demo
        $ mkedanlzr DemoAnalyzer
        $ cd DemoAnalyzer
        ```

        This will create several template files in the new DemoAnalyzer directory. For more information about CMSSW analyzer modules, have a look in [the CMS open data guide](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/cmssw/cmsswanalyzers/).

        Compile the code with:

        ```shell
        $ scram b
        ```

        You can ignore the message

        ```
            ****WARNING: No need to export library once you have declared your library as plugin.
                    Please cleanup src/Demo/DemoAnalyzer/BuildFile by removing the <export></export> section.
        ```

        or take action and remove the indicated section from ```BuildFile.xml```.

        Change the file name in the configuration file ```demoanalyzer_cfg.py``` in the DemoAnalyzer directory. Take, for example, the [SingleMu dataset](/record/24460) from Run2012D i.e. replace ```file:myfile.root``` with ```root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2012D/SingleMu/AOD/22Jan2013-v1/10000/0015EC7D-EAA7-E211-A9B9-E0CB4E5536A7.root```.
        
        Change the max number of events to 10 (i.e change -1 to 10 in ```process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input = cms.untracked.int32(-1)```).

        Run the code with:

        ```shell
        $ cmsRun demoanalyzer_cfg.py
        ```

        and you will get an output like:

        ```

        This is a simple loop over the first 10 events in the file. To access the physics object information, for example that of muons, add the following lines in `src/DemoAnalyzer.cc` (the lines before and after of the lines to be added are also shown):

        ```shell

            Handle<reco::MuonCollection> mymuons;
            iEvent.getByLabel("muons", mymuons);

            //if collection is valid, loop over muons in event
            if(mymuons.isValid()){
                for (reco::MuonCollection::const_iterator itmuon=mymuons->begin(); itmuon!=mymuons->end(); ++itmuon){
                    muon_e.push_back(itmuon->energy());
                }
            }

            //print the vector
            for(unsigned int i=0; i < muon_e.size(); i++){
                std::cout <<"Muon # "<<i<<" with E = "<<muon_e.at(i)<<" GeV."<<std::endl;
            }

        #ifdef THIS_IS_AN_EVENT_EXAMPLE
        [...]
        ```

        Modify the `BuildFile.xml` to include `DataFormats/MuonReco` dependencies so that it becomes:

        ```shell
        <use name="FWCore/Framework"/>
        <use name="FWCore/PluginManager"/>
        <use name="DataFormats/MuonReco"/>
        <use name="FWCore/ParameterSet"/>
        <flags EDM_PLUGIN="1"/>
        ```

        Compile and run again with:

        ```shell
        $ scram b
        $ cmsRun demoanalyzer_cfg.py
        ```

        The output gives the energy of muons in these events:

## <a name="nice">"Nice! But how do I analyse these data?"</a>

In AOD files, reconstructed [physics objects](/docs/cms-physics-objects-2011) are included without checking their "quality". For example, the reconstructed objects in the electron collection / muon collection that you printed out are not guaranteed to be from validated data. In order to analyse only the "good quality" data, you must apply some selection criteria. 

=== "2010"

        Depending on the nature of your analysis you *can* run your analysis code directly on the AOD files themselves, if needed, performing the selections along the way. However, this can be resource-intensive and is done only for very specific usecases.

        **NOTE**: To analyse the full event content, the analysis job needs access to the "condition data", such as the jet-energy corrections. To see how the connection to the condition database is established, you can check the [Guide to the CMS condition database](/docs/cms-guide-for-condition-database). For simpler analyses, where we use only physics objects needing no further data for corrections, you do not need to connect to the condition database. This is the case for the example for analysing the primary datasets below.

        Your final analysis is done using a software module called an "analyzer". If you have followed the validation step for the virtual machine setup, you have already produced and run a simple analyzer. You can specify your initial selection criteria within the analyzer to perform your analysis directly on the AOD files, or further elaborate the selections and other operations needed for analysing the reduced dataset. To learn more about configuring analyzers, follow [these instructions in the CMSSW WorkBook](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookWriteFrameworkModule). Make sure, though, that you replace the release version (CMSSW_nnn) with the release that you are using, i.e. one that is compatible with the CMS open data.

        You can also pass the selection criteria through the configuration file. This file activates existing tools within CMSSW in order to perform the desired selections. If you have followed the validation step for the virtual machine setup, you have already seen a configuration file, which is used to give the parameters to the `cmsRun` executable. You can see how this is done in our analysis example.

        We will now take you through these steps through a couple of specially prepared example analyses.

        <summary> <a name="a">Option A: Analysing the primary dataset</a> </summary>
        <br>
        As mentioned above, you do not typically perform an analysis directly on the AOD files. However, there may be casese when you can do so. Therefore, we have provided an example analysis to take you through the steps that you may need on the occassions that you want to analyse the AOD files directly. You can find the files and instructions in [this CMS     analysis example](/record/560).
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary> <a name="1"> Step 1: Reducing the AOD files to PATtuples </a> </summary>
        
        We start by applying selection cuts via the configuration file and reduce the AOD files into a format known as PATtuple. You can find more information about this data format (which gets its name from the CMS Physics Analysis Toolkit, or PAT) on the [CMSSW PAT WorkBook](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookPAT).
        
        **Important**: Be aware that the instructions in the WorkBook are in use in CMS currently and have been updated for more recent CMSSW releases. With the 2010 data, you should always use the releases in the series of CMSSW_4_2 and not higher. Also note that more recent code does not work with older releases, so whenever you see `git cms-addpkg...` in the instruction, it is likely that the code package this command adds does not work with the release you need. However, the material under the pages gives you a good introduction to PAT.
        
        Code as well as instructions for producing PATtuples from the CMS open data can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/ayrodrig/pattuples2010). However, since it took a dedicated computing cluster nine days (!!!) to run this step and reduce the several TB of AOD files to a few GB of PATtuples, we have provided you with the PATtuples in that GitHub repo, saving you quite a lot of time! So you can jump to the next step, below ("Performing your analysisâ€¦"). Although you do not need to run this step, it is worth looking at [the configuration file](https://github.com/ayrodrig/pattuples2010/blob/master/PAT_data_repo.py):

        You can see that the line `removeAllPATObjectsBut(process, ['Muons','Electrons'])` removes all "PATObjects" but muon and electrons, which will be needed in the final analysis step of this example.

        Note also how only the validated runs are selected on lines:

        ```python
        import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms
        import PhysicsTools.PythonAnalysis.LumiList as LumiList
        myLumis = LumiList.LumiList(filename='Cert_136033-                                                149442_7TeV_Apr21ReReco_Collisions10_JSON_v2.txt').getCMSSWString().split(',')
        process.source.lumisToProcess = cms.untracked.VLuminosityBlockRange()
        process.source.lumisToProcess.extend(myLumis)
        ```

        This selection must always be applied to any analysis on CMS open data, and to do so you must have the validation file downloaded to your local area.

        When using the "CMS-OpenData-1.1.2" VM, it is recommended reading the condition data as instructed in the [Guide to the CMS condition database](/docs/cms-guide-for-condition-database). Set the symbolic links to the condition database for 2010 data

        ```
        ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_R_42_V10A FT_R_42_V10A
        ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_R_42_V10A.db FT_R_42_V10A.db
        ```

        Then replace the Global Tag definition on lines 45â€“46 in the file `PAT_data_repo.py` with

        ```
        #globaltag
        process.GlobalTag.connect = cms.string('sqlite_file:/cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_R_42_V10A.db')
        process.GlobalTag.globaltag = 'FT_R_42_V10A::All'
        ```
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary> <a name="pat"> Step 2: Performing your analysis on the PATtuples </a> </summary>
        
        Now, as the intermediate PATtuple files have been produced for you, you can go directly to the next step, as described in [this second GitHub repo](https://github.com/ayrodrig/OutreachExercise2010) and follow the instructions on that page.

        Note that even though these are derived datasets, running the analysis code over the full data can take several hours. So if you want just give it a try, you can limit the number events or read only part of the files. Bear in mind that running on a low number of files will not give you a meaningful plot.

        Your analysis job is defined in `OutreachExercise2010/DecaysToLeptons/run/run.py`. The analysis code is in the files located in the `OutreachExercise2010/DecaysToLeptons/python` directory.

        This example uses IPython, which gets configured and starts the job with the following command:

        ```python
        ipython run.py
        ```

        That's it! Follow the rest of the instructions on the README and you have performed an analysis using data from CMS. Hope you enjoyed this exercise. Feel free to play around with the rest of the data and write your own analyzers and analysis code. To exit IPython, enter `exit()`.

=== "2011/2012"

        First of all, you will need to apply a filter for validated data. Then, you will want to apply some identification and selection criteria, such as if the objects in your analysis are isolated from or close to other particles in the same collision.

        For a quick start on how to do this and to write out the most common objects and their properties, use the "Physics Object Extractor Tool (POET)" available in [this repository](https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/PhysObjectExtractorTool/tree/2012). You can use [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch) to inspect reconstructed particles and the distributions of their properties.

        Start by getting the code and compiling it. Make sure that you are back in the **CMSSW_5_3_32/src/** folder. If you are using the VM, do the git command to get the code in the "Outer shell" terminal. Go to the right folder with `cd ~/CMSSW_5_3_32/src`. In the container, keep using the normal container shell and go to the right folder with `cd $CMSSW_BASE/src`.

        ```shell
        $ git clone https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/PhysObjectExtractorTool.git
        ```
        If you are using the VM, change now back to the "CMS shell" terminal. Get the 2012 "branch" of the repository and, always in the **CMSSW_5_3_32/src/** folder, compile the code with:

        ```
        $ cd PhysObjectExtractorTool
        $ git checkout 2012
        $ scram b
        ```

        **NOTE**: To analyse the full event content, the analysis job needs access to the "condition data", such as trigger information or jet-energy corrections. In the VM, the condition database is made available through the `cvmfs` file system, and in the container, the condition data can be read from predefined condition data servers. In both cases, reading the condition data for the first time can take very long. For the 2011 and 2012 collision and simulated data, a selection of condition databases is provided locally in the `cmssw_5_3_32-slc6_amd64_gcc472` container, and the access is much faster. Comment or uncomment the lines related to condition data depending of your environment following the instructions in the configuration file `PhysObjectExtractor/python/poet_cfg.py`. See detailed instructions for the use of condition data for different data-taking years in [the guide to the CMS condition database](/docs/cms-guide-for-condition-database).

        Note also how only the validated runs are selected in the configuration file. The relevant lines are:

        ```python
            import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms
            import FWCore.PythonUtilities.LumiList as LumiList

            [...]

	        goodJSON = "data/Cert_190456-208686_8TeV_22Jan2013ReReco_Collisions12_JSON.txt"
	        myLumis = LumiList.LumiList(filename=goodJSON).getCMSSWString().split(",")
	        process.source.lumisToProcess = CfgTypes.untracked(
	    	        CfgTypes.VLuminosityBlockRange())
	        process.source.lumisToProcess.extend(myLumis)
        ```

        This selection must always be applied to any analysis on CMS open data, and to do so you must have the validation file downloaded to your local area.

        To produce a root file with selected objects, do the following:

        ```shell
        $ cd PhysObjectExtractor
        $ cmsRun python/poet_cfg.py
        ```

        The configuration file sets it to run over 1000 events in a simulated dataset.

        If you are using the CMS open data container with the VNC application installed (see the [container guide page](/docs/cms-guide-docker#vnc)), for opening the graphical user interface, start the VNC application in the container by typing

        ```shell
        $ start_vnc
        ```

        and then start a VNC viewer on your local computer using the password `cms.cern`. The http option for a GUI in the browser is not guaranteed to work in the container with this CMSSW version.

        You can now open the POET output file in ROOT:

        ```shell
        $ root myoutput.root
        ```

        You will see the ROOT logo appear on screen. You can now open the ROOT GUI by entering:

        ```shell
        TBrowser t
        ```

        and you will see the ROOT browser window:

        <img src="/static/docs/getting-started-with-cms-2011-data/getting_started_with_cms_2011_2012_data_1.png" width="70%">

        Now, let us take a closer look at some collections of physics objects.

        On the left window of ROOT, double-click on the file name (`myoutput.root`). You should see a list of names, each corresponding to a collection of reconstructed data.

        Let us take a peek, for example, at the muons, which are found in `mymuons`. Look in there by double-clicking on that line and then double-clicking on `Events`. Here, you can have a look at various properties of this collection, such as the transverse momentum of the muon: `muon_pt`. Double-click on it to draw the distribution.

        <img src="/static/docs/getting-started-with-cms-2011-data/getting_started_with_cms_2011_2012_data_2.png" width="70%">

        You can exit the ROOT browser through the GUI by clicking on `Browser` on the menu and then clicking on `Quit Root` or by entering `.q` in the terminal.

        That's it! Hope you enjoyed this exercise. Feel free to play around with the rest of the data and write your own analyzers and analysis code. Learn more in [the CMS Open data guide](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/) and have a look at the other example analysis workflows such as the [tool to produce reduced "NanoAOD" format for outreach and education](/record/12340) and the example analyses on its output implemented in python for the [di-muon spectrum](/record/12342) or the [Higgs boson decay to two tau leptons](/record/12350), or the Higgs decay to four leptons implemented in [C++](/record/5500) or using [ROOT's RDataFrame](/record/12360), or the [di-muon spectrum analysis using Julia](/record/22350).
