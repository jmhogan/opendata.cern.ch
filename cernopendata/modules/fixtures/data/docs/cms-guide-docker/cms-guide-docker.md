## <a name="intro">Introduction</a>

You can run CMS analysis code in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container provided together with the CMS open data. If you have not already installed Docker, instructions for installation are [provided by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). For an introduction and for getting started, you can follow the links provided in [the CMS Open data guide](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/tools/docker/).

## <a name="nanoaod">Available general-purpose container images</a>

The quickest way to get started analyzing CMS open data is to consider data in the NanoAOD format, either [derived data from
Run 1](https://opendata.cern.ch/search?q=&f=experiment%3ACMS&f=type%3ADataset%2Bsubtype%3ADerived&l=list&order=desc&p=1&s=10&sort=mostrecent) or [NanoAOD from Run 2](https://opendata.cern.ch/search?q=&f=experiment%3ACMS&f=file_type%3Ananoaod&f=file_type%3Ananoaodsim). These file formats can be analyzed using ROOT and python tools. The container images linked
here contain the packages required to access open data files over the network.

**ROOT container**: this image contains ROOT 6 coupled with Python 3 and a VNC server for access to the graphical user interface.

**Python container**: this images contains Python 3 with a HEP software stack and a VNC server for access to the graphical user interface. HEP-related python packages in this image include `awkward`, `uproot`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `jupyterlab`.

## <a name="images">Available CMSSW container images</a>

For the first access of each set of CMS open data, you will need a specific container image containing the software corresponding to that particular set of data. The following images are available:

## <a name="fetch-start">Fetch an image and start a container</a>

In the following instructions, make sure to replace the example container image name according to the table above.
These commands are for 2015 proton-proton data, with the CMSSW version 7_6_7 and the `cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493` container image.

Once you have installed Docker on your computer, you can fetch a container image, and create and start a container using the `docker run` command:

```sh
docker run -it --name my_od -P -p 5901:5901 -p 6080:6080 cmsopendata/cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493 /bin/bash
```

Here we fetch the `cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493` docker image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/cmsopendata) and name the container `my_od`.

This will install a stand-alone CMSSW image (several gigabytes). Therefore this may take a while. However, the image will only have to be downloaded once. The following will appear in your terminal, with messages changing during the download:

```console
$ docker run -it --name my_od -P -p 5901:5901 -p 6080:6080 cmsopendata/cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493 /bin/bash

Status: Downloaded newer image for cmsopendata/cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493:latest
Setting up CMSSW_7_6_7
CMSSW should now be available.
This is a standalone image for CMSSW_7_6_7 slc6_amd64_gcc493.
```

Once done, in a CMSSW container you should see the commmand prompt for the CMSSW instance within Docker:

```console
(/code/CMSSW_7_6_7/src)
```

If you are using a linux distribution on WSL2, and do not get this prompt, but get back to your local terminal prompt, see the instructions [below](#on-wsl2) under "Running CMS open data containers on WSL2".

**Non-CMSSW containers**: in the ROOT or Python containers the pull output will look very similar to the example above,
but without any messages about setting up CMSSW. After the image has been downloaded you will see a command prompt in the `code/` directory:

```console
(/code)
```

## <a name="commands">Useful commands</a>

In the following, some useful commands are given. For a complete list of commands, see the [docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

#### <a name="exit-start">Exiting and restarting a container</a>

When you want to exit the container simply type `exit`.

If you want to restart the container (e.g. the one named `my_od`) and return to your work then use the command

```sh
docker start -i my_od
```

#### <a name="rm">Removing a container</a>

You can remove the container `my_od` with

```sh
docker rm my_od
```

This does not remove the image, which took long to download. You can create a new container from that image with the same `docker run ...` command as above, but it will be much faster than the first time.

If the container was created and started using the `--rm` option (e.g. `docker run --rm ...`) then the container will be removed when you exit.

#### <a name="cp">Copying files</a>

You can copy file out of a runnning container to your local computer. Create an file in the container (for example) with

```sh
echo $SHELL > $HOME/example.txt
```

In order to copy this file out of a running container, open another terminal of your local computer and run one of the following commands:

```sh
docker cp my_od:/home/cmsusr/example.txt .  # for CMSSW container
docker cp my_od:/code/example.txt . # ROOT or Python container
```

Likewise, in order to copy a file into a running container:

```sh
docker cp <my file> my_od:/home/cmsusr/ # for CMSSW container
docker cp <my file> my_od:/code # for ROOT or Python container
```

#### <a name="mount">Mounting a local file area in the container</a>

It is possible to create a local directory system and mount it in the container, so that files are shared automatically without
needing to copy in and out of the container. If you already have a container, exit from the container and remove it using the <a href="#rm">docker rm</a> command. For CMSSW containers in particular it is important to create the working area with the
proper permissions before creating the container.

```sh
export workpath=$PWD
mkdir cms_open_data_work
chmod -R 777 cms_open_data_work
```

Then create a container that includes mounting information through the `-v` option.

```sh
docker run -it --name my_od -P -p 5901:5901 -p 6080:6080 -v ${workpath}/cms_open_data_work:/code cmsopendata/cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493 /bin/bash
```

#### <a name="exec">Execute a command in a running container</a>

You may need to submit a command from your local host into a running container. For example, to see the running processes in the `my_od` container, run:

```sh
docker exec my_od ps -ef
```

## <a name="graphics">Graphics</a>

#### <a name="vnc">VNC</a>

For opening graphics windows, the container image has a VNC application installed. Start the VNC application in the container with

```sh
start_vnc
```

You can either install a VNC viewer (e.g. TigerVNC) on your local computer (Linux, MacOS or Windows) and start the viewer there, or open the graphics window in your browser with the http address given in the message.

Connect with the default VNC password `cms.cern`.

Each time you exit from the container, close the VNC application with

```sh
stop_vnc
```

You can find more details on the configuration and usage of VNC in the CMS open data containers in [the image repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-cloud/cmssw-docker-opendata/-/tree/master#use-vnc).

#### <a name="x11">X11 forwarding on Linux</a>

If you are running on a Linux computer, you can also use X11 forwarding. If you already started a container name `my_od` and now decide to use X11 forwarding instead of VNC, exit from the container shell with `exit`, remove the existing container with `docker rm my_od`. Then start a new container with

```sh
docker run -it --name my_od --net=host --env="DISPLAY" -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/home/cmsusr/.Xauthority:rw cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493 /bin/bash
```

#### <a name="test-graphics">Test graphics</a>

You can test if the graphics window opens by typing in the container shell

```sh
root
```

In the `root [0]` prompt, type

```sh
TBrowser t
```
This will open the ROOT browser window. You can exit ROOT with `.q` in the `root[..]` prompt, or from the browser window menu.

If you are new to ROOT, have a quick look to [the Getting started page](/docs/cms-getting-started-2015), or follow the links in [the CMS open data guide](https://cms-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/tools/root/).

#### <a name="prompt">Container prompt</a>

If the container prompt causes trouble for line wrapping, increase the size of the terminal. If it does not help, you can change the prompt with

```sh
export PS1="(\w) "
```

To change it permanently, add this line to the file `/home/cmsusr/.bashrc` in the container.

#### <a name="jupyter">Launching Jupyter in the Python container</a>

The <a href="#nanoaod">Python container</a> supports jupyter notebook usage though the container. To access this tool, create
a new python container with port 8888 enabled as well as the other ports in the original example:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -P -p 5901:5901 -p 6080:6080 -p 8888:8888 gitlab-registry.cern.ch/cms-cloud/python-vnc:latest
```

Inside the container, launch jupyter-lab with the following command. You will see output that includes a link:

```console
$ jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser

```

Paste the `http` link into your browser to access a jupyter-lab session where you can create notebooks and see your existing notebooks.

## <a name="get-started">Install and run CMS example code</a>

If you have read the instructions above, you can now follow the getting started instructions for CMS [AOD data (Run 1)](/docs/cms-getting-started-aod), [MiniAOD data (Run 2)](/docs/cms-getting-started-miniaod), or [NanoAOD data (Run 2)](/docs/cms-getting-started-nanoaod).

## <a name="on-wsl2">Running CMS open data containers on WSL2</a>

The CMSSW open data containers, or any CentOS6-based containers, may fail if docker is run on WSL2. This problem is fixed by adding a new file `.wslconfig` with the following contents

```sh
[wsl2]
kernelCommandLine = vsyscall=emulate
```

in the `\Users\<username>` folder (make sure that it is saved without extension), then shutting down with `wsl --shutdown` in the Windows command prompt and restarting again.

Test that the settings are properly passed by doing, in the WSL2 linux installation:

```sh
docker run -ti ubuntu cat /proc/cmdline
```

The ouput should contain `vsyscall=emulate`, e.g.:

```sh
initrd=\initrd.img panic=-1 pty.legacy_count=0 nr_cpus=4 vsyscall=emulate
```

## <a name="cvmfs">Accessing cvmfs from a container</a>

The CMS open data container images contain the software needed for analysis, and the CMS condition database can be accessed from predefined locations. In the container images for standard proton-proton data, they are stored in a local `/cvmfs` file system. Therefore, when using these containers, access to the namespace `/cvmfs` (CernVM-File System) at CERN for software and condition data access is not mandatory.

If desired, it is possible to "see" the full cvmfs space by installing the cvmfs client following [the official instructions](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io). In essence, there are two basic ways to achieve this:

The preferred option is to [install](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-quickstart.html) the cvmfs client locally, on the host machine, and [mount](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-configure.html#bind-mount-from-the-host) it on the container:

```sh
docker run --name my_od -it -v "/cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch:/cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch:shared" cmsopendata/cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493 /bin/bash
```

Do not mount the full `/cvmfs` or `/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch` areas as that will overwrite necessary settings in the local `/cvmfs` area of the container.

The other option is to [install](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-quickstart.html) the cvmfs client directly in the container after it is created (only working for the slc6-based containers). For this, the container needs to get started in [privileged](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-configure.html#mount-inside-a-container) mode like

```sh
docker run --privileged --name my_od -it cmsopendata/cmssw_7_6_7-slc6_amd64_gcc493 /bin/bash
```
